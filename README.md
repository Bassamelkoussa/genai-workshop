# GenAI Workshop

Please see the `genai-workshop.ipynb` which serves as the self-contained workshop. 

The other notebook, `data-prep.ipynb`, contains the logic used for staging the workshop data, originally sourced from the [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data).
