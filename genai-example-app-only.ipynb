    "In this workshop, you will learn how to use Neo4j Knowledge Graphs to make Large Language Models (LLMs) useful for more real-world use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We walk through an example that uses real-world customer and product data from a fashion, style, and beauty retailer. We show how you can use a knowledge graph to ground an LLM, enabling it to build tailored marketing content personalized to each customer based on their interests and shared purchase histories. We use a pattern called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to accomplish this.  Specifically, one that leverages not only vector search but also graph pattern matching and graph machine learning to provide more relevant personalized results to customers.\n",

    "- Using graph patterns in Cypher to improve semantic search with context\n",
    "- Further augmenting semantic search with knowledge graph inference & ML\n",
