# Talent GraphRAG Workshop
In this workshop, you will learn:

- How to create a **knowledge graph** from both structured and unstructured data sources.

- Techniques for **graph pattern matching**, **vector search**, and **graph analytics** to retrieve information, uncover insights, and identify relationships in your data. 

- How to use a knowledge graph to power a **GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent**.

We will use a talent dataset as a practical example, exploring how to analyze employee skill sets, identify similar skills, form clusters or cohorts, and build a talent agent capable of answering questions about people, their skills, and relationships within the graph.
